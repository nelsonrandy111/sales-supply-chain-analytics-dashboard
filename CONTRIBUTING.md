# Contributing to Sales & Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
- Use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features
- Include detailed information about the problem
- Provide steps to reproduce the issue
- Include your R version and package versions

### Suggesting Features
- Open an issue with the "enhancement" label
- Describe the feature and its benefits
- Include mockups or examples if possible
- Explain how it fits into the existing architecture

### Code Contributions
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Test thoroughly
5. Commit with clear messages (`git commit -m 'Add feature: description'`)
6. Push to your branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`)
7. Open a Pull Request

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow R style guidelines (use `styler` package)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and modular

### R Code Standards
```r
# Good
calculate_customer_lifetime_value <- function(purchases, time_period) {
  # Calculate CLV based on purchase history
  total_revenue <- sum(purchases$amount)
  avg_order_value <- total_revenue / nrow(purchases)
  return(avg_order_value * time_period)
}

# Avoid
calc_clv <- function(p, t) {
  return(sum(p$amt)/nrow(p)*t)
}
```

### Testing
- Test your changes with different data scenarios
- Ensure the Shiny app runs without errors
- Verify that all interactive elements work correctly
- Test with both small and large datasets

### Documentation
- Update README.md if adding new features
- Add comments to complex functions
- Include examples in documentation
- Update package dependencies if needed

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- R (version 4.0+)
- RStudio (recommended)
- Git

### Local Development
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `install_packages.R` to install dependencies
3. Ensure data files are in the `data/` directory
4. Test the application with `shiny::runApp()`

### Data Files
- Keep large data files out of the repository (use .gitignore)
- Provide sample data for testing
- Document data format requirements

## Project Structure

### Key Files
- `app.R` - Main Shiny application
- `clustering_cleaning.R` - Data preprocessing
- `customer_clusters.R` - Consumer clustering
- `business_cluster.R` - Business clustering
- `install_packages.R` - Package installation script

### Adding New Features
1. **New Analysis**: Create separate R script
2. **New Visualization**: Add to appropriate tab in `app.R`
3. **New Data Source**: Update `clustering_cleaning.R`
4. **New Clustering**: Create new script following existing patterns

## Code Review Process

### Pull Request Guidelines
- Provide clear description of changes
- Include screenshots for UI changes
- Test with different data scenarios
- Update documentation as needed

### Review Checklist
- [ ] Code follows R style guidelines
- [ ] Functions are well-documented
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing functionality
- [ ] Tests pass successfully
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Dependencies are properly managed

## Bug Reports
